# Dotfiles

These are my unix dotfiles. 

While I spent a lot of time tinkering with neovim in the past, I don't have the patience to keep up with breaking changes in plugin management and language servers. I now use [AstroNvim](https://docs.astronvim.com/).

### Install

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/install.sh
./scripts/config.sh
```

## CLI Programs
- neovim - better vim
- starship - shell prompt
- ripgrep - better grep
- bat - better cat
- exa - colorized ls
- fnm - node version manager
- tldr - lookup common commands
- fzf - general fuzzy search
- dust - better du
- lf - ranger, but not python
